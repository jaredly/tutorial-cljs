(defn ^:export read-eval-call
  "Reads, evaluates and calls back with the evaluation result.

  The first parameter is a map of configuration options, currently
  supporting:

  * `:verbose` will enable the the evaluation logging, defaults to false
  * `:warning-as-error` will consider a compiler warning as error
  * `:target` `:nodejs` and `:browser` supported, the latter is used if
  missing
  * `:init-fn!` user provided initialization function, it will be passed a
  map:

          :form   ;; the form to evaluate, as data
          :ns     ;; the current namespace, as symbol
          :target ;; the current target

  * `:load-fn!` will override replumb's default `cljs.js/*load-fn*`.
  It rules out `:read-file-fn!`, losing any perk of using `replumb.load`
  helpers. Use it if you know what you are doing and follow this
  protocol:

      ```
      Each runtime environment provides a different way to load a library.
      Whatever function `*load-fn*` is bound to will be passed two arguments
      - a map and a callback function: The map will have the following keys:

          :name   - the name of the library (a symbol)
          :macros - modifier signaling a macros namespace load
          :path   - munged relative library path (a string)

      The callback cb, upon resolution, will need to pass the same map:

          :lang       - the language, :clj or :js
          :source     - the source of the library (a string)
          :cache      - optional, if a :clj namespace has been precompiled to
                        :js, can give an analysis cache for faster loads.
          :source-map - optional, if a :clj namespace has been precompiled
                        to :js, can give a V3 source map JSON

      If the resource could not be resolved, the callback should be invoked with
      nil.
      ```

  * `:read-file-fn!` an asynchronous 2-arity function with signature
  `[file-path src-cb]` where src-cb is itself a function `(fn [source]
  ...)` that needs to be called with the file content as string (`nil`
  if no file is found). It is mutually exclusive with `:load-fn!` and
  will be ignored in case both are present

  * `:src-paths`  a vector of paths containing source files
  * `:no-pr-str-on-value`  in case of `:success?` avoid converting the
  result map `:value` to string

  The second parameter, `callback`, should be a 1-arity function which receives
  the result map, whose result keys will be:

  ```
  :success?  a boolean indicating if everything went alright
  :value     (if (:success? result)), this key contains the yielded value as
             string, unless :no-pr-str-on-value is true, in which case it
             returns the bare value.
  :error     (if-not (:success? result)) will contain a js/Error
  :warning   in case a warning was thrown and :warning-as-error is falsey
  :form      the evaluated form as data structure (not string)}
  ```

  The third parameter is the source string to be read and evaluated.

  It initializes the repl harness either on first execution or if an
  option in `#{:src-paths :init-fn!}` changes from the previous
  `read-eval-call`."
