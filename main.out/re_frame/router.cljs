;; -- Router Loop ------------------------------------------------------------
;;
;; Conceptually, the task is to process events in a perpetual loop, one after
;; the other, FIFO, calling the right event-handler for each, being idle when
;; there are no events, and firing up when one arrives, etc. The processing
;; of an event happens "asynchronously" sometime after the event is
;; dispatched.
;;
;; In practice, browsers only have a single thread of control and we must be
;; careful to not hog the CPU. When processing events one after another, we
;; must hand back control to the browser regularly, so it can redraw, process
;; websockets, etc. But not too regularly! If we are in a de-focused browser
;; tab, our app will be CPU throttled. Each time we get back control, we have
;; to process all queued events, or else something like a bursty websocket
;; (producing events) might overwhelm the queue. So there's a balance.
;;
;; The original implementation of this router loop used core.async. It was
;; fairly simple, and it mostly worked, but it did not give enough
;; control. So now we hand-roll our own, finite-state-machine and all.
;;
;; The strategy is this:
;;   - maintain a queue of `dispatched` events.
;;   - when a new event arrives, "schedule" processing of this queue using
;;     goog.async.nextTick, which means it will happen "very soon".
;;   - when processing events, do ALL the ones currently queued. Don't stop.
;;     Don't yield to the browser. Hog that CPU.
;;   - but if any new events arrive during this cycle of processing, don't do
;;     them immediately. Leave them queued. Yield first to the browser, and
;;     do these new events in the next processing cycle. That way we drain
;;     the queue up to a point, but we never hog the CPU forever. In
;;     particular, we handle the case where handling one event will beget
;;     another event. The freshly begat event will be handled next cycle,
;;     with yielding in between.
;;   - In some cases, an event should not be run until after the GUI has been
;;     updated, i.e., after the next reagent animation frame. In such a case,
;;     the event should be dispatched with :flush-dom metadata like this:
;;       (dispatch ^:flush-dom [:event-id other params])
;;     Such an event will temporarily block all further processing because
;;     events are processed sequentially: we handle each event before we
;;     handle the ones behind it.
;;
;; Implementation
;;   - queue processing can be in a number of states: scheduled, running, paused
;;     etc. So it is modeled explicitly as a FSM.
;;     See "-fsm-trigger" (below) for the states and transitions.
;;   - the scheduling is done via "goog.async.nextTick" which is pretty quick
;;   - when the event has :flush-dom we schedule via
;;       "reagent.impl.batching.do-later"
;;     which will run event processing after the next reagent animation frame.
